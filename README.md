My Personal Website is a simple html site to promote my personal portfolio, freelance work, overall experience and knowledge as a front end web developer.
The site is built using bootstrap v5, with plain html, sass (css), as well as some javascript and jquery.
The portfolio page uses metaphizzy's isoptope layout library for grid sorting and filtering options.
The sass is compiled using prepos.
The site has a colour picker that allows users to change the colours, as well as enable dark or light mode, which has all been built using javascript & jquery.
